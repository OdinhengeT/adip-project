# adip-project
Course project in Advanced Digital Image Processing, Linear discriminant analysis for recognising differences, code written in MatLab. 

Note: One must obtain the MRI Data on their own, it is not distributed within this repository.

* main.m - will run the algorithm and visualize which parts of the brain were found important in the  desicion process.

* pca_cross_validation.m - performs cross-validation to determine the number of principal components.

* shaving_cross_validation.m - performs cross-validation to determine what fraction of voxels should be retained in the decision process.

* test.m - contains early testing of the PCA and LDA algorithms
